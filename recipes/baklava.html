     <h1>Ingredients</h1 >
             
<ul>
        <li>Phyllo Dough</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
        <li>Water </li>
        <li> Sugar </li>
        <li> Vanilla </li>
        <li> and Honey</li>
     </ul>
<h1>steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base. Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon. Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone. Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.    </li>
    
    <li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan. Bake until golden and crisp.

    </li>
    <li>Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it. Let cool before serving.</li>
    
    <li>Baklava is super sugary, so it has a relatively long shelf-life. It will last for about two weeks stored in an airtight container. Keep it in the pantry if you like your baklava crispy. If you like it chewy, opt for the fridge.</li>
     
    <li>Yes, you can definitely freeze baklava. Just let it cool completely, wrap it in a layer of storage wrap, and then a layer of aluminum foil. Follow with another layer of aluminum foil for added protection. Freeze for up to three months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.</li>
